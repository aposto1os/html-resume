<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> 
      My name is Apostolos Pantazopoulos and I am a constructions electrical engineer.
    I recently decided to pursue a career in the field of software engineering.
    In order to achieve this goal I started by learning a programming language and 
    after getting my first steps with C and Python I prefered to continue with Java.
    I 've attained the OCA certification and I currently study for the OCP certification.
    I also began exploring Spring Boot.  
    Regarding front-end technologies I have gained familiriaty with HTML and CSS and 
    have the incentive to continue with Javascript and REACT.  
    Other technologies that I have familiriaty with are Git and Github, 
    Maven and Testing Frameworks like Junit and Selenium. 
    In order to have a more formal education I have also enrolled in EAP's Master's degree 
    in Information Systems.
